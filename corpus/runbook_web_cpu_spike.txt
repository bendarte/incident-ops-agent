Title: Runbook - Web Server CPU Spike
Date: 2026-01-20
Category: Operational Procedures
Version: 1.2

Description:
This runbook outlines the procedure for responding to a sudden and sustained CPU spike on production web servers (e.g., above 90% for more than 5 minutes).

Symptoms:
- Alert: `High CPU Utilization on Web Server (server-X)`
- Increased application error rates (5xx errors)
- Slow response times from web services

Action Plan:
1.  **Verify Alert:** Log into `monitoring.example.com` and confirm CPU utilization for the affected server(s). Check `top` or `htop` on the server via SSH.
2.  **Check Recent Deployments:** Review recent deployments in `jenkins.example.com` for any changes that might have introduced performance regressions.
3.  **Inspect Logs:** Examine web server access logs (`/var/log/nginx/access.log` or `/var/log/apache2/access.log`) for unusual traffic patterns or errors. Check application logs (`/var/log/app/app.log`) for internal errors.
4.  **Restart Service (if necessary):** If the issue persists and no immediate cause is found, attempt to restart the web service.
    *   `ssh user@server-X 'sudo systemctl restart nginx'` (for Nginx)
    *   `ssh user@server-X 'sudo systemctl restart apache2'` (for Apache)
    *   Monitor CPU after restart.
5.  **Scale Up/Out:** If restart doesn't resolve the issue, or if traffic surge is identified, consider scaling up the affected instance or scaling out by adding more instances.
    *   Consult with `CloudOps` team for scaling procedures.
6.  **Incident Creation:** If the issue is severe or prolonged, create a new incident ticket in Jira using the template `WEB-CPU-SPIKE`.

Escalation:
- If CPU remains high after 30 minutes, escalate to on-call SRE.
- If web service is unresponsive for more than 10 minutes, escalate to on-call SRE.

Post-Incident:
- Document findings and actions in the incident ticket.
- Review and update this runbook if new insights are gained.
